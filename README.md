# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Leanne Dong. I am a Australian independent audio developer (Once upon a time I was a researcher in stochastic processes, then turned into a Mathematician after PhD, then turned into a C++ developer during the last two postdocs). I'm used to work on music information retrieval. Before that I worked at [ENCS, Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/offices/ci/ifo/ENCS.html) as a Postdoctoral Fellow. My focus during postdoc has been Environmental Engineering and xAI software development with C++. My formal academic training has been in Mathematics.
Currently I'm dabbling multimedia projects around audio software development to hardware design. 

* Enjoy audio software development, love hardware and mathematics. NOT interested in participating any competitions or job tests!
* MATH := {heart, wellness, hapiness, ...}
* MATH != Finance or Money
* No money eager folks! No trading headhunters!
