# Hi there 👋

My name is Leanne J Dong (levynoise). Here is my brief outdated [CV](https://github.com/leannejdong/briefCV).
A freelance audio C++ developer and independent IT with a Maths PhD (USYD) and two postdoc fellowships in Computer Science.
I provide a wide range of IT services, from audio or custom software development to IT infrastructure planning, transformation and networking.
I am proficient in cross platform development and deployment for either creative or scientific applications. My passion lies between alternative art and baremetal tech. Open to contracting!
For all business enquiries please get in touch on levynoise@spacetimeit.com
If you cannot reach me over email I'm mostly under water or out to the sun :)

* Key skills: C++, Audio programming, Linux, networking, IT infrastructure, server virtualization
* Lately deployed apps over my home server (offline during 2-8am weekday, 2-10am weekends):
  - [Beauty booking](https://snaskiama.taile88eb0.ts.net/)
  - [Chords learning](https://snaskiama.taile88eb0.ts.net/chord-lab)
* Last project (Legacy):
  - Carbon Electra Synthesizer for electronic music production
