# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Leanne Dong. I am a Aussie-based independent developer (Once upon a time I was a researcher in stochastic processes (semi-business-woman), then turned into a Mathematician after PhD, then turned into a programmer during the last two postdocs). I'm used to work on music information retrieval. Before that I worked at [ENCS, Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/offices/ci/ifo/ENCS.html) as a Postdoctoral Fellow. My focus during postdoc has been Environmental Engineering and xAI software development with C++. My formal academic training has been in Mathematics.
Currently I'm interested in fun projects around audio/music theory, cryptography/digital assets, network/audit security, quantitative finance, you name it...
