# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Leanne Dong. I am a Mathematician and a Postdoctoral Software Developer from [ENCS, Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/offices/ci/ifo/ENCS.html). My current focus has been Engineering and AI software development.
Mostly in modern C++ and a little Python. Prior to my C++ addiction, I programmed mostly in R (for roughly 9 years).
On the one hand, I am hoping to develop fluency in C++ and contribute to the standardlization process; On other hand,
I'm keen about learning new tools and languages features that help problem solving in real world. 
Warning: I am not good enough. But, I am determined for a career in C++. Please do not attempt to modify what I've been in love with :alien:.
