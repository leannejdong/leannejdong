# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Leanne Dong. I am a Mathematician and a Postdoctoral Software Developer from [ENCS, Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/offices/ci/ifo/ENCS.html). My current focus has been Engineering and AI software development.
An average day of my work is mostly C++ and some Python.
