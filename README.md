## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Leanne Dong. I am a Mathematician and a Postdoctoral Software Developer from [ENCS, Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/offices/ci/ifo/ENCS.html).
I'm keen about learning new technology and other languages. But my current focus has been C++ and a little Python. (Mostly C++11, 14, 17, learning C++20)
Before C++, I programmed mostly in R for roughly 9 years.
